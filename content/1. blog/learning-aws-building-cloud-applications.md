I've been a front end developer the last 2 years of my career. Prior to that, I worked as full stack dev for a company where all the software was developed for internal use and always deployed on premises servers. 

This year, I decided I want to go back to full stack and back end development. Looking at the skills needed to be a competent back end developer in today world, one of the most common ones is cloud computing. I haven't had much experience with the cloud, other that setting up some private virtual servers. For those reasons I decided to become proficient with AWS.

In this blog, I'll share that journey. 

I started studying to get a Developer Associate certification, while doing so I found this blog post in A Cloud Guru that recommends getting all Associate level certifications before moving on to get a Professional one. That became my new objective. 

> I will learn about AWS and got myself the three Associate certifications. 

## How am I gonna do it?

When I took the decision to learn AWS I thought at first "I will grab a Udemy course, study it, book a certification exam, pass it, and done!"

Then I really sat down to think about it. Why do I want to learn AWS? Is it for the certification? Do I really need it (the certificate) in the first place? The answer was of course NO. I don't need the certification. I want to become a back end developer.

Once I have a clear objective in mind the next step was to trace a plan to achieve it.

If my goal was to create software using AWS, then the best options for me was to learn by building software using AWS!

Good, I have a plan now. Well kind of. Still need to define what am I building. I don't want to create an "dummy" applications for the sake of learning. I never really learned front end frameworks by writing another To Do List app. The frameworks I know and can use with ease are the once I learned by building complex software, relevant for me or for my job.

I did some research. Most of the sites suggested deploying a static site to AWS as a good first application to start getting familiar with it. 

And that is how this blog was born.

I will post here regularly about the applications I'm building as part of my cloud learning journey.
